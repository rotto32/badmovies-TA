# Bad Movies
A teaching assignment designed to cover the fundamentals of fullstack

Learn the fundamentals of application structure and database integration by making a web app that renders horrible movies based on certain search criteria. The user can then opt to save a movie to their favorites and also delete items from their favorites that they don't like anymore. 

### Basic functionality (CRUD app minus update functionality): 

[ ] User should be allowed to search for movies by genre

[ ] User should be given a list of official genres to choose from

[ ] Movies should be sorted to show the movies with horrible ratings first (figure out how to modify the API endpoint to do so)

[ ] User should be able to click on a movie within the search results in order to save it to their favorites (mySQL database, you must make your own Schema)

[ ] If a user is viewing their favorites they should be able to delete a movie from their favorites by clicking on it

### The API for the application:
